                    <h4>Basics</h4>
            
                    <p>Chenile is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) framework to build Microservices using a unique Modulith architecture in Java using Spring Boot. Chenile establishes standards, conventions and provides common services to get developers immediately productive. It enables developers to focus on functionality.</p>
                    <p>Chenile is like a fabric. You can use it to stitch Micro services. You can write services without worrying about transports, middlewares, horizontal services, transformations etc. Chenile allows these to seamlessly incorporated by framework architects whilst allowing developers to write functional code.</p>
                    <p>Chenile is a Java Library that contains framework code. But the framework code is just the tip of the iceberg. Chenile comes bundled with a code generator that generates typical boiler plate code that conforms to a blue print. (such as a HTTP over JSON Micro Service for example). This juxtaposition of blue prints makes it incredibly powerful and productive.</p>
                    <p>Chenile separates the developers from architects. It allows architects to focus on central concerns such as:
                    <ol>
                    <li>Standardization - standardize tech stacks (both the framework and the version to be used)</li>
                    <li>Enforcing modular development</li>
                    <li>De-couple horizontal concerns from functionality</li>
                    <li>Design test harnesses to enable extensive testing</li>
                    <li>Enable automatic logging and observability</li>
                    <li>Enable internationalization from day One</li>
                    <li>Introduce a service registry where all the service metadata is stored in one place. Chenile needs to know about all the services since it knows how to intercept them and invoke them.</li>
                    <li>Design message formats, generic responses, exception handling etc.</li>
                    <li>Design the structure of code repositories, devOps and build practices etc.</li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <p>Best of all Chenile ships with a code generator that generates code that complies to these blue prints. This code can give you a huge jumpstart.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="who">
                    <h4>Who ?</h4>
                    <p>Are you an early stage startup who wants to focus on developing industrial strength services using well established patterns without wasting time to research on the optimal tech stack or browsing through reams of documentation? If yes, Chenile can help you there</p>
                    <p>Are you a Spring Boot developer who is able to write code but struggle with best practices? Chenile can recommend specific frameworks and tell you to integrate them into your application. It generates stub code that you can use to write your functionality.</p>
                    <p>Are you a big enterprise who finds it hard to standardize the tech stack or patterns? Chenile can help you with that. Chenile can be completely customized as well which makes it a great framework to build all standardization efforts. </p>
                    <p> Are you a software developer who would like to leverage multi-module maven builds? Chenile has you covered!</p>
                    <p></p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="patterns">
                    <h4>Patterns & Blue Prints</h4>
                    <p>Chenile encapsulates our learning from multiple projects from many years. It distills this knowledge into established patterns. We wrote supporting code to allow developers to implement these patterns. We wrote code generators that create stubs that developers can then use to implement functionality. By using Chenile documentation, libraries, patterns and code generators, developers can produce industrial strength code on day one. Not on day 180! </p>
                    <p>Chenile  identifies common usecases that can be solved - eg. developing microservices, creating 'mini-monoliths' (more on this later) etc. These use cases become Chenile blue prints. Code generators help in generating code that conforms to these blue prints. Chenile is first and foremost an accelerator to design a complete micro services ecosystem using Modulith principles.</p>
                    <p>Do you want to use CQRS? Chenile has its own blue print to develop modulith services using the CQRS pattern.</p>
                    <p>Our workflow , query and interceptor blue prints are easy to understand and ship with documentation. These are generated by the code generator</p> 
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="extensible">
                    <h4>Extensible</h4>
                    <p>Chenile encourages customization. An org can override any part of Chenile for its specific needs. Chenile provides multiple extension points - at the org level, at the service level and even at the service method (operation) level.</p>
                    <p>We love SOLID principles. The framework is built to be extensible. Every part of Chenile is designed to be extensible. It is possible to change the request processing of Chenile. It is trivial to write new blue prints and integrate with chenile. The code generator can be customized to generate code compliant to these blue prints. </p>
                    <p>The Chenile Interceptor Framework can be customized to your organization and even at the service or operation level!</p>
                    <p>Chenile also ships with configurable options for most of its features. These can be used to extend the framework and customize the services. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pipeline">
                    <h4>Lightweight Request Processing Pipeline</h4>
                    <p>Chenile started out as a light-weight alternative to a SEDA pipeline implementation that runs within the same JVM. The idea was to provide an ability to do last-mile interception. This de-couples horizontal concerns from functionality. Last mile interception allows orgs to push a lot of customization into services without needing to invest in expensive customization in the API Gateway layer. Chenile recommends API Gateway as an excellent upstream interception layer before the services. However, it is hard to customize API Gateways. Certain concerns such as transformation must be handled close to the services and therefore make an excellent concern that could be implemented in the last mile.</p>
                    <p>We wanted to make this last-mile interception work in a transport agnostic manner i.e. it should work across HTTP, KAFKA, message queues etc. By doing so, we wanted to re-use the pipeline across transports.</p>
                    <p>Chenile ships with interceptors that could implement important horizontal concerns such as transformation, caching, exception handling etc. It integrates with myriads of different frameworks that facilitate logging, auditing, i18n etc.</p>
                    <p>The pipeline code is super extensible. Chenile supports a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to customize the pipeline. </p>
                    <p>Chenile also supports its own super-flexible exchange object. It also introduces a Generic Response object that could communicate errors, warnings etc. back from the service layer </p>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="workflow">
                    <h4>Chenile State Machine</h4>
                     <p>Chenile supports a state machine to automate workflows and event sourcing</p>
                     <p>State machines can be attached to <i>stateful entities</i> i.e. entities that contain a state field. The state field determines what events (which often translate into UI actions) are applicable to these entities in that state.It is possible to store additional metadata for the state. This can be used in the program. </p>
                     <p>For example, an order can transition from an Opened to "In Process" to "Fulfilled" to "Closed" states. As it marches through these states, the order can be mutated in interesting ways using "events". These events depend on the state of the order. Upon receipt of an event, the order can transition to another state or stay in the same state. </p>
                     <p>The Chenile state transition machine (STM) allows these states and transitions to be configured externally using a State Transition Diagram (STD). A workflow engine navigates through the STD and calls registered handlers for every event that occurs to the state entity. In the Order example, the STM calls appropriate handlers when the order transitions from the Opened to the the "In Process" state for example.</p>
                     <p>The STM supports event sourcing as well.<p>
                    <p>See <a href='/chenile-stm.html'>state transition machine</a> for more information.</p>

            <p>This is all cool.. but doesn't Spring Boot already provide these ?</p>
            <p>We agree that Spring Boot is an awesome ecosystem. In fact, we like it so much that we built Chenile on top of Spring Boot! Spring Boot is not opinionated. This is good because it caters to different use cases. Chenile seeks to impose certain opinionated standards on Spring Boot development. These standards cover a gamut of things - from simple naming conventions to recommending certain design paradigms to standardizing how Maven must be used etc. </p>
            <p>These standards are automatically incorporated in Chenile Micro services if the Chenile code generator is used. For example, it takes less than 5 minutes to generate a Spring Boot micro service that does the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Have a multi module Maven project which separates development concerns from deployment and implements the Dependency inversion principle (DIP) of SOLID</li>
                <li>Supports multiple transports - HTTP being one of them</li>
                <li>Adheres to established naming conventions</li>
                <li>Generates Swagger docs and other files that allow us to document this service in a service registry</li>
                <li>Adheres to established ways of implementing a work flow or CQRS or any of the other Chenile blue prints</li>
                <li>Incorporates horizontal concerns seamlessly</li>
                <li>Uses standardized exception handling</li>
                <li>emits a response in one standard format with provision to return exceptions, errors and warnings</li>
                <li>Uses international message bundles</li>
                <li>Implements test cases with a sophisticated Cucumber test harness and a standardized Gherkin language</li>
                <li>Facilitates versioning strategies and builds a CI/CD pipeline</li>
                <li>incorporates observability </li>
                <li>and much much more. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> This obviates the need for developers to wade through endless documentation, stack overflow pages and sift through multiple opinions. In short, you have more time to implement functionality without worrying about semantics, best practices etc. (which you will also eventually learn by looking at Chenile's documentation)</p>
            <p>In short, Chenile makes you productive on day one instead of waiting for months!</p>
            <p>&lt;EOF&gt; END of hard sell. Phew! Now let us take a deep breath and get back to writing some cool programs using Chenile!</p>
