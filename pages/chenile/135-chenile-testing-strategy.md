summary: We explain the concepts of shifting left in testing
---
A test framework must enable users to test early and test often. This should also be combined with modulith principles. We want testing to happen independent of the packaging. Conceptually, there are two types of testing strategies:
1. Strategies that require an environment - such as acceptance testing (whether it is QA, end user etc.), performance testing etc.
2. Strategies that can run on ephemeral environments - such as unit testing, limited integration testing etc.
