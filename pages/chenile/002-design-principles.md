# Design Principles

## Event Driven 
Focus on events to enable highly de-coupled systems
## Task Driven
Enforce state managed domain models with HATEOAS enabled
## Configuration Driven Service Policies
All service polices must be configured separately so that they can be applied at different levels by different components in the Aurora ecosystem
