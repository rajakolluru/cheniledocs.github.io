summary: Chenile - Usage Patterns
---
Chenile consists of a bunch of tools. It can be used as a whole for software development. In case that is not feasible, Chenile libraries can be used in isolation. Here are some recommended usages:
* Chenile CLI tool (app-gen) generates scaffolding that automatically enforces Chenile design principles. This can be used to give a jumpstart for applications. It is possible to use the CLI to generate applications that comply to non Chenile recommended blue prints as well. 
* Specific frameworks such as Chenile query, Chenile State Transition Machine (STM) , orchestration wizard can be used without using the entire Chenile infrastructure. 
* Chenile Gherkin language allows developers to quickly develop BDD tests. This can be used in isolation without the rest of Chenile.
